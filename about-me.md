## About Me
I am an undergraduate student at Morgan State University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics. With a strong interest in the intersection between ethics and artificial intelligence, my goal is to learn to leverage technology for social good. After completing my bachelor's degree, I plan to earn advanced degrees in Computer Science with a focus on AI/ML to develop systems that enhance accessibility and representation within diverse communities. I also plan on being a part of various organizations that will give me the tools to reach my goals, as well as connect me to other like-minded individuals.
