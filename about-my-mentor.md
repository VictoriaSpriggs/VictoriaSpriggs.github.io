## About My Mentors

My faculty mentor, Dr. Nyarko, is also the director of CEAMLS. He will make sure that as a lab, we are on track with our projects and provide critiques when necessary. My graduate mentor, Cynthia Nosiri, is a third-year PhD student at Morgan State University studying Engineering. Her focus is on Large Language Models and how they can be trained to be less biased. She will assist all of us in our individual roles so we can combine our parts and create one cohesive project. Our other graduate mentor, Daniel Stephens, will provide us with tips and insights so we can create the most effective version of EmotiGen.
