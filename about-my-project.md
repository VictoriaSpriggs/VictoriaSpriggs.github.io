## About My Project

EmotiGen

Problem: Generative AI algorithms have issues understanding and responding to diverse users because of a lack of training.

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing prompts that will accomplish the following:

- Have the program understand the user's language (in this case, African American Vernacular English).
- Process and understand the user's emotions based on their understanding of their language.
- Recieve an output that properly responds to the users emotions.

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in an app that can understand and respond to the user's emotions by either affirming positive feelings or motivating those with negative emotions.
