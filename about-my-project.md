## About My Project

EmotiGen

Problem: Generative AI algoriths have issues understanding and responding to diverse users because of a lack of training. 

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing prompts that will accomplish the following:

  - Have the program understand the users language (in this case, African American Vernacular English).
  - Process and understand the users emotion based on its understanding of their language.
  - Recieve an output that properly responds to the users emotions. 

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in an app that can understand and respond to the users emotions by either affirming positive feelings or motivating those with negative emotions.
