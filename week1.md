During my first week in the institute, I gained many skills. I was taught how to read and manipulate data, research conduct, lab conduct, and how to write in Python. This week I was able to meet a lot of new people from various educational backgrounds. I was also able to learn how to communicate with my peers through the collaborative activities like playing kahoot and the marshmallow structure challenge. I found that this internship will require me to learn many new things at an accelerated pace, something that I'm not quite used to. At first I was concerned about my ability to complete my tasks, but this week I was given the proper tools to take the time to learn and grow while completing my work. In the intro to mahine learning workshop, I learned how to use a Logistic Regression algorithm and a Random Forest Classification Model. Using these helped me understand some of the inticacies of the decision making process of AI. I did find it difficult to understand some of the topics in the Data Analysis workshop but once things slowed down I was able to grasp the harder concepts. Overall, it was a fun week that allowed me to get out of my comfort zone both academically and socially.
