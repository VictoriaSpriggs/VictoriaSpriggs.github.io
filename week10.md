Since we finished our preparation for the final symposium presentation last week, we just spent a bit of time this week doing run-throughs of our presentation to make sure everything ran smoothly. After we made sure everything was put together for our presentation, we spent some more time writing and revising our technical paper. The presentations went well, and I feel we were able to explain our project very well. After the presentation, I was approached by someone who works at JHU APL, and my teammate Lenny and I spoke about our project. That was a cool experience because at that moment I realized I was able to go in-depth about my project without being too confused. I feel like over the past 10 weeks I was able to learn so much that will be of value to me as I go deeper into my major. Thank you again to all of those who gave me the opportunity to be a part of this program and gave us the resources to do such meaningful work!
