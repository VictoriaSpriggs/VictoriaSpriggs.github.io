This week, I got familiar with prompt engineering techniques and familiarized myself with a few LLMs. I also chose a prompt engineering technique and LLM for this project and set up the chosen LLM for chatting. I successfully created and tested a few prompts on the model. I found that the model was having issues running when I initially set it up. First, I was having issues gaining access to the model but then I used my hugging face token to solve the issue. Now the model runs, but it executes slow, so I have to find a way to make it run faster. The model we are using is Metaâ€™s Llama-3-8B-Instruct. We are using this because of its strengths in understanding conversational nuances and completing complex tasks.
