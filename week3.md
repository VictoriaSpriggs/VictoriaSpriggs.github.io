This week, I fixed the slowness of the model with the help of my mentor, researched the RAG prompting technique and created a RAG model for our program. I was able to learn more about prompting techniques,  specifically retrieval augmented generation (RAG)and its usefulness for our project. I implemented the RAG model with Llama 3 model we are using for our bot. The main issue I had was optimizing the code to use less storage and run faster. I’m still working on finding solutions but at the moment it looks like I’m just going to have to get more memory. My group was also able to get new data in order to creat a more culturally competen bot. This data will be used in the RAG model to create said bot.
