This week I had to write a draft of the abstract for our research paper. Dr. Pandey also gave us an assignment where we were supposed to write a summary of two articles we read related to our project. Another thing I did this week was finish writing the prompts we would be using to test the RAG model. The data we are using for this project was fully cleaned by Tuesday so the group moved on to annotating the data. That means labeling each sentence with the emotion(s) we think are associated with them. For example, if a sentence said “I ain’t doing all that” we might label it as annoyed. We annotated 500 random samples of our data. On Thursday, we had the opportunity to present our work to a group of high schoolers. We could show the prototype of the app and explain the reasoning for our research. Now we are spending time preparing for the Mid-Summer Symposium.
