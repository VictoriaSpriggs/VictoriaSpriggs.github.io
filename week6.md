This week I got to use the completed RAG model. Now the only issue is its output. The model works, however it gives more output than it needs to. Our goal is to have it just show the conversation the user has with the chat bot, similar to Chat-GPT.  We also completed and spent some time practicing our presentation for the Mid-Summer Symposium. It was challenging because a few of us suffer from stage fright and we had a hard time verbalizing the things we did over the past month. We able to get a clean presentation that describes the project and our work well.
