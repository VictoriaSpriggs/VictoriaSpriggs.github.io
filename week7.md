I spent the first two days of this week preparing for the mid-summer presentations. After that, I could focus on the research paper we were supposed to write. So far I’ve made a draft of the abstract and I’m working on the introduction and methodology. It’s been a challenge writing because it’s difficult to verbalize what I’ve been doing during this program. To help me write what I did, I took some time to read more research papers about the topics we were researching in our project. It has helped me learn new ways to present ideas, as well as gain a deeper understanding of the topics we are researching. Doing this has also helped me create a draft for a literature review.
