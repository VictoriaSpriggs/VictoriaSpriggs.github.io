This week we finished our RAG model and finalized the prompt we will use in our model. We are still trying to figure out how to get the model to not produce an excessive amount of responses to one input, however the model still seems to understand what we are saying when we use AAVE. In the beginnign when we used the model, it would use AAVE too much, and it often came off as mocking. Now, because of the changes we made in the prompt, the model only uses aave when the other person uses it. Overall the issues with the model are minor but the main goal has been met!
