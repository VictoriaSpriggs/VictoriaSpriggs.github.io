This week we spent most of our time writing our first drafts of our research paper. We were able to figure out what we did and didn't want to discuss in our paper, as well as who was writing what. We also spent some time figuring out how we were going to format our presentation. We want to make our work stand out. A lot of our time was spent practicing what we were going to say because we had to spend 20 minutes discussing our work, which can be difficult. I spent some time doing more research on the technologies and methods I used in my work on this project because I want to be as prepared as possible when answering questions.
